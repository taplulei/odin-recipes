<p>One of the most loved foods in the world is finally here! This is a traditional Italian Lasagna, made the Italian way with layers of slow cooked Bolognese ragu and cheese sauce.</p>

            <li>  1/2 tsp each dried thyme and oregano</li>

              <li>1/2 tsp salt and black pepper</li>
              <li>60g / 4 tbsp butter</li>
              <li>1/2 cup (75g) flour</li>
              <li>4 cups (1 litre) milk (I use low fat)</li>
              <li>2 cups (200g) shredded cheese (Colby, Gruyere, Cheddar, Monterey Jack, OR 1 cup shredded parmesan) (Note 4)</li>
              <li>Pinch of freshly ground nutmeg</li>
              <li>350g/ 12 oz fresh lasagna sheets (or 250g/8oz dried) (Note 5)</li>
              <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
              <li>Finely chopped basil or parsley , for garnish (optional)</li>
              <li></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet - they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
    <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
    <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
    <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich - see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required (Note 3)</li>
    <li>Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional - just makes sauce thicken faster).</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix constantly for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a whisk if needed to make it lump free.</li>
    <li>Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly after a few minutes until sauce thickens - about 5 - 8 minutes. It should coat the back of the wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable - the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over the Ragu when layering - see video). If it's too thick, add a splash of water or milk.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
    <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5" baking dish.</li>
    <li>Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear sheets to fit.</li>
    <li>Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.</li>
    <li>Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1 more time.</li>
    <li>Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining Cheese Sauce.
    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and bubbling.
    </li>
    <li>Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with basil or parsley if desired.
    </li>

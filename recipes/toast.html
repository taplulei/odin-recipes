    <h4>A quick and easy snack for kids when the cupboard is bare. This is not a dessert!</h4>
    <p>Toast is bread that has been browned by radiant heat. The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction, altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. </p>

        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp milk</li>
